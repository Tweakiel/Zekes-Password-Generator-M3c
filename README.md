# Zekes-Password-Generator-M3c

I made this password generator as a part of my module 3 assignment from my boot camp. This task was meant to demonstrate what we learned for **javascript**. 
in this instance, we used **functions(declared and expressive)**, **if statements**, **methods** and much more.

## GitHub Deployment Pages Link
[Zeke's Password Generator](https://tweakiel.github.io/Zekes-Password-Generator-M3c/)

## Usage

To use this Password Generator, you can access the link above and then press the generate button. 
After, the script asks the user for specific parameters/criteria. this includes (password length, characters, capital and numbers).
There are **conditions** for this script to work, the length is limited to 8 minimum characters and 128 characters maximum, and
at least *one* criteria must be picked.

## Acceptance Criteria for Assignment
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```


## Preview & Demo
Here is what the generator looks like

Here is a demonstration of how it works :)

## Other/Note
if you have checked my script.js, you'll notice that i have **put console.log()** throughout some of the **if** instances and my **for** loop
This is merely a check method for myself, and my instructor to check if the password is truly generated but also to see that **if** statements
and loops do work.
